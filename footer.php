Before he entered sales, he had already solidified his expertise and skills in negotiations. In his first 12 months of sales, alone, he sold tens of millions in residential and investment properties, negotiated hundreds of thousands in closing costs and credits, and has helped dozens of first time home buyers find their first home, all single handedly and without a team. He now has a team based out of Capitol Hill where he trains and strategizes with daily ensure more buyers and sellers get the same attention, dedication, and rewards that he has always delivered..</p>
		  <h5>PASSION.</h5>	
<p class="body-description">His professionalism and expertise are second only to his passion for helping others. He is passionate about protecting his client throughout the entire process of buying or selling a home. Simply finding a home or a buyer for a home is the job of any broker; finding a home or buyer, researching, providing resources, strategizing, negotiating, and guiding you along the way as a full service consultant is how he differs. He’s been known to make sacrafices to ensure the safety of his clients. Brian is more than just your broker, but your friend to make your experience as stress­-free as possible before, during, and after your transaction.</p>
		  <h5>SERVICE.</h5>
<p class="body-description">Helping others is simply his nature. Local volunteer with Seattle Works, Seattle OneBrick, Roxhill Elementary, and the 45th Street Homeless Youth Clinic.

<p class="body-description">Avery fell in love with the city of Seattle when she was very young. All of the unique, diverse architecture and bustle of the city inspired her early on, eventually leading her to becoming a real estate broker. She has a soft spot for the old historical buildings mixed with new modern high rise construction that’s so prevalent in Seattle.<br>
Her love for meeting new people and hearing their stories ties in perfectly with the work she does. Nothing makes her happier than knowing she can make a living doing what she loves, and helping people in the process. Her passion for connecting with people paralleled with her expertise makes for an above and beyond home buying/selling process.</p>

<p class="body-description">Sean gained his experience and professionalism early on at the age of fourteen. He began working as a Teppanaki Chef in his home town of Bellingham WA. While cooking for his clients in a very personable and engaging environment, he developed his communication and listening skills at a very young age. He was able to continue and learn these traits while finishing up high school and into culinary school at Bellingham Technical College. After culinary school he moved to Seattle where he continued his passion for cooking and sales. Sean then went to Benihana Seattle. After spending a year at Benihana and gaining tons of experience in a large corporate franchise he went on to help a friend open up a restaurant in Pioneer Square for the next two years.</p>

<p class="body-description">After spending 10 years working in restaurants, he decided to take his passion for food and his love of sales and combine them. He joined a  startup company, heading up the Sales Department of a three man operation food distribution company. The mission was to help create a local and sustainable food culture you see in Pacific Northwest today. Sean spent the last nine years building a company as Vice President. During which he developed incredible negotiating skills, writing contracts, whole sale volume purchasing and selling products to some of the largest food institutions and highest end restaurants in Washington and Oregon. Sean’s nature has always been to get the job done and willing to work 24 hours a day to care for his clients.</p>

<p class="body-description">Sean brings his own personal experiences of buying and selling real estate to help educate folks on: the benefits of owning a home vs renting, how to make money on investment properties and what area’s to watch for when thinking of making a purchase. He’s also aligned himself with mentors and friends who have over 30 years of experience in both Real Estate, Investments and Lending. He would like to offer an amazing experience from the moment he brings you on as a client whether you’re a buyer, seller, and investor or if you simply just have a  question.<br>
Thanks for meeting him, Sean.

                        <h4 class="service_header text-center">Steps to Buying a House</h4> 
                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Decide if it’s the right time to buy</h5>
                        <p>Consider why you want to move; decide on what’s important in a home. Think about what you want in a home including location, features, finishes, and ability to customize.</p>
                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Find a broker</h5>
                        <p>Choosing the right broker is important — find a broker that you can easily communicate with, and one you can trust to get you your dream home, not just any home. </p>
                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Find a lender</h5>
                        <p>Ask your broker for their preferred lender. Pre-approval is essential to strike as soon as you come across your dream home. The speed of the offer can greatly affect the purchase price.</p>
                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Search</h5>
                        <p>It’s normal to have long periods of time where no new listings stand out, but it is important to maintain communications with your broker and lender. Your broker scans through over a hundred new listings a day.</p>
                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Submit an offer</h5>
                        <p>Time is of the essence and your broker has strategies to submit your offer. Review, scrutinize, and sign any documents for your broker as soon as possible.</p>
                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Stay close to your phone!</h5>
                        <p>Negotiations may begin as soon as the seller reviews the offer. Stay close to your phone but at the same time, keep yourself from becoming too anxious as it may take days to hear back.</p>

                        
                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Inspect home</h5>
                        <p>If the offer is accepted, the next step is to inspect the home. The inspector will identify defects while educating you on home maintenance.</p>
                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Open escrow</h5>
                        <p>All ‘behind the scenes’ work goes into overdrive as the brokers, escrow, title, sellers, lenders, and any attorneys begin transacting the sale. Your broker will oversee every party in the transaction.</p>
                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Signing and close!</h5>
                        <p>Prior to close, you will sign papers. On the actual day of closing the transaction will finalize and you are the owner of your new home. Congratulations!</p>

                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Agent vs. Broker:</h5>
                        <p>In Washington, all professionals who sell real estate are licensed brokers. In 2010 Washington ceased the agent certification.</p>
                        <h5 class="service_subheader">A Buyer’s Broker is Free:</h5>
                        <p>Whether a buyer uses their agent or not, the seller will pay the same
commission. It’s of the best interest of the buyer to have someone educating, negotiating, and protecting.</p>
                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Full-time vs. Part-time:</h5>
                        <p>Most agents are part-time or even hold other jobs. Full-time, full-service brokers have full-time attention for you and your search, and cost you the same — free!</p><br>

                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Truth: <span class="inline_paragraph">A quality broker will have resources to guide you and be able to help you even in the initial stages.

Be wary of brokers who ask you to contact them only when you’re “serious” or “ready”.</span></h5> <br>

                        <h5 class="service_subheader">Truth: <span class="inline_paragraph">A quality broker will negotiate the absolute best deal for you in any situation you are in. Brokers who offer buyer credits, such as those who work for discount firms, work with many buyers at a time thus are unable to give you the that you deserve. For example: you receiving $4,000 in credits may cost you $8,000 in closing costs and tens of thousands in other negotiations a full service, fully attentive broker would have won for you.!</span></h5> <br>
